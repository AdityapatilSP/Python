    "#### Introduction to the Rock, Paper, Scissors Project\n",
    "Now that all the necessary knowledge has been acquired, it is time to tackle the final project of the day: a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that can be played against the computer. The game begins by prompting the user to type 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a choice is made, the program displays a graphic representing the user's selection, followed by the computer's randomly generated choice. The outcome is then determined based on the official rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Breaking Down the Problem\n",
    "The core of the game is to randomly select between rock, paper, or scissors for the computer, compare it with the user's choice, and determine the result: win, lose, or draw. The official rules can be referenced for clarification. ASCII art for each shape is provided and stored in variables, which can be printed directly without quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Planning the Game Logic\n",
    "- It is helpful to break down the larger problem into smaller, manageable tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate a random number between 0 and 2 to represent the computer's choice.\n",
    "- Obtain the user's choice via input.\n",
    "- Compare both choices using the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\n",
    "- Display the appropriate ASCII art and outcome."
